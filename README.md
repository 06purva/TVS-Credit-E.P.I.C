Providing loans to customers while maintaining a strong portfolio has become challenging for lenders due to an increase in fraudulent customers. It is essential to grant loans only to deserving and appropriate customers to avoid difficulties or harm to the lenders. Manually reviewing Excel sheets, documents, and other data to verify whether a customer is genuine is a tiring process and prone to human error. Therefore, the objective is to streamline this manual process and achieve more accurate results by automating it. This can be accomplished by developing a model that evaluates a customer's background based on various features such as EMI, credit card history, loan history, and credit scores to detect whether the customer is fraudulent.

The approach involves using multiple machine learning algorithms to extract relevant features for fraud detection. These features are then integrated into a hybrid model, which is trained using specific rules and conditions to achieve a high accuracy rate in identifying fraudulent customers.

By employing machine learning (ML) techniques, the solution will automate the fraud detection process that traditionally relies on manual checks of data in Excel sheets. The ML model will be trained using various algorithms to identify the most relevant features for detecting fraudulent customers, thereby enhancing accuracy and efficiency. The thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) process will be used to select these features, significantly improving the model's performance.
This approach will reduce the likelihood of human error and ensure more accurate and consistent results in identifying high-risk individuals. Automating the fraud detection process will streamline operations, minimize financial losses due to fraud, and enhance the overall quality of the loan portfolio. Consequently, the solution will lead to more secure and efficient lending practices, protecting the financial health of the organization while improving decision-making capabilities.
